# LinkedIn Voice Navigator

LinkedIn Voice Navigator is a Chrome extension that enhances the user experience on LinkedIn by adding voice command functionality and making the "Saved Posts" feature more accessible.

## Features

- **Easy Access to Saved Posts:** LinkedIn has a feature called "Saved Posts", but it's a bit hidden and not easily accessible. This extension adds a "Saved Posts" button directly to the LinkedIn navigation bar, making it easy to find and access your saved posts from any page.

- **Voice Command:** This extension adds voice command functionality. You can use the following voice commands:
  - Say "open post" to open the saved posts page.
  - Say "go home" to navigate to the LinkedIn feed.
  - Say "open jobs" to navigate to the LinkedIn jobs page.
  - Say "open messages" to navigate to the LinkedIn messaging page.
  - Say "view profile" to navigate to your LinkedIn profile.
  - Say "view notifications" to navigate to your LinkedIn notifications.
  - Say "view network" to navigate to your LinkedIn network page.
  - Say your command with "search " followed by your query to perform a search on LinkedIn.
